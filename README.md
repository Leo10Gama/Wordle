# Wordle
A Python-based implementation of the game Wordle.

Just for clarification, the original Wordle game was made by [Josh Wardle](https://powerlanguage.co.uk/) and this project is just something I wrote up out of quarantine boredom, along with wanting to practice my own strategies for the game. All credit for the game and original site belong to Josh.
