# Wordle
A Python-based implementation of the game Wordle.

Just for clarification, the original Wordle game was made by [Josh Wardle](https://powerlanguage.co.uk/) and this project is just something I wrote up out of quarantine boredom, along with wanting to practice my own strategies for the game. All credit for the game and original site belong to Josh.

# Running the App
Since this is gaining traction, here's how to use this for yourself (ensure you have `python3` installed, but preferrably `python3.8`).

- Download the repository
- Navigate to the place you downloaded it to in your favourite terminal
- Run the command `python3 main.py` (or `python3.8 main.py`)
- Enjoy!

Alternatively, you can run `python3 wordle.py` to play some Wordle, or `python3 solver.py` to use the solver. Both of these tools are available through the `main.py` module.
